1. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability present in the insecure version arises from the application's handling of user input 
without proper validation or sanitization before using it in a database query (insecure.js). 
This vulnerability is known as NoSQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate queries and potentially 
access unauthorized data by injecting malicious code into inputs that are directly used in database operations. 
In this case, the application directly uses user-provided values in the database query to find a user by their username, 
without checking if the input is malicious. This could let an attacker craft special input that could manipulate the query, 
leading to unauthorized access to user information or other malicious outcomes.

The secure version (secure.js) prevents this vulnerability by adding input validation and sanitization steps 
before the database query is executed. It checks if the username is a string and removes non-alphanumeric characters 
from the input using a regular expression. This sanitization process ensures that any malicious characters that could 
be used to manipulate the database query are stripped out, effectively preventing NoSQL injection attacks. 
By validating and sanitizing user input, the application significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access 
or manipulation of the database.

2. Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Integrity

3. What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Least Privilege Access: Ensure that the database user the application connects with has the least privileges 
necessary to perform its functions. This minimizes the potential impact of a successful injection attack.

Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews: Conducting regular security audits and code reviews can help identify 
and mitigate vulnerabilities like injection flaws before they can be exploited.

Security Training for Developers: Providing developers with training on secure coding practices and awareness 
of common vulnerabilities like injection attacks can help prevent such issues from being introduced into the code.
