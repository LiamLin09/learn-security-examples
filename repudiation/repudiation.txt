- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper auditing and authentication mechanisms.
specifically, the application does not:
1. keep a record of who sends message or accesses them.
2. the routes '/send-message' and '/get-message' do not require any form of user authentication. this means anyone can send message
or retrieve them without having to identify themselves.

the secure version introduces several improvements to prevent repudiation:
1. It logs every request to the server, including the IP address of the requester, the type of request, and the specific action taken 
(e.g., sending a message).
2. Although the code snippet simulates authentication (const isAuthenticated = true;), 
it introduces a placeholder for actual authentication logic. The intent is to ensure 
that only authenticated users can send or retrieve messages. Authentication is a critical component for 
establishing the identity of users and linking actions to them, thereby significantly reducing the risk of repudiation.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

1.Secure Logging: Ensure that logs are tamper-evident and stored securely.
2. Regular Audits: Perform regular security audits of the system to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities 
that could be exploited for repudiation or other attacks.
