- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

vulnerability occurs in the route handler for '/userinfo', where the application uses user-provided input
directly in a database query without any validation or sanitization.
an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input in the id parameter that
could manipulate the query to return unauthorized data or perform other malicious actions within the databse context.

the secure version attempts to mitigate this vulnerability by wrapping the database query within a 'try-catch' block.
using 'try-catch' block can handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of the query.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

1. Input Validation: Ensure all user input is validated against a strict set of rules before it is used in database queries.
2. Sanitization: Sanitize inputs to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters.
